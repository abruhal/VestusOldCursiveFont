VestusOldCursive is a Unicode typeface intended for transcribing Old Roman Cursive, 
the scribal script of the roman empire from around 100BC - 400AD. The letterforms and metrics are based on those of
Vollkorn - the rest of the software is not, and was instead cobbled together in fontforge by a
novice. 
I decided to create this font when I could not find any alternatives online, so I doubt there
is much demand for Old Roman Cursive typefaces. Because I'm probably the only person going to use
Vestus, I excused some kerning inconsistencies (particularly with the block capitals) and wonky 
letterforms - feel free to fix or modify this font in any way as it is far from a complete product.



TIRONIAN NOTES KEY

Tironian "AB"		| [)]
Tironian "AD"		| [(]
Tironian "ET" 		| [&]
Tironian "ERGO" 	| [@]
Tironian "NON"		| [~]

Tironian "UBI"		| [$]

The "ET", "ERGO", "NON", and "SED" characters 
havewider spaces on each side and are 
intended to be used without spaces 
(interpuncts), for example to use Tironian "ET"
in the phrase "optumum et uerissumum" you would
write "optumum&uerissumum". 

Othet Tironian characters can be used with
regular spaces.
